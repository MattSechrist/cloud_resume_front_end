# Cloud Resume Challenge - The Front End
This repo hold the HTML, CSS, JS and assets for my AWS S3 one-page website showcasing my resume.

I use Github actions for CI/CD purposes, and my workflow uses the Cypress testing framework to verify 3 items:
 1. Is https://matthewsechrist.cloud up and does it respond correctly?
 2. Does the redirect from www.matthewsechrist.cloud to matthewsechrist.cloud work?
 3. Does my HTTP API respond correctly with the visitor counter?
